In order to measure scarcity, we use the signal of the electricity price on the wholesale electricity market. Our recommendation system then aims at recommending the cheapest device launching hours (at wholesale electricity prices). Therefore, our system should enable to recommend hours at which there is less scarcity.\r\n","\r\n","In order to perform that calculation, we need to collect and pre-process electricity price data. Given that the households of the REFIT Dataset are located in Great Britain, we collect hourly day-ahead electricity prices on the British wholesale electricity market. \r\n","\r\n","In the following, we pre-process the raw electricity-price data collected at ENTSOE and define the **Price_Agent** that returns the relevant price data for a single recommendation."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Ht6KVdfeaTTC"},"source":["## **1.
