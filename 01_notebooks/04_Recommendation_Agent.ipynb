It orchestrates how the **Activity_Agent**, **Usage_Agent**, **Load_Agent** and **Price_Agent** interact in order to deliver a recommendation at a particular date for a given household (see the dedicated notebooks in order to see the definition of these agents in detail).\n","\n","The recommendation agent works as follows:\n","\n","1. It requests the outputs of the **Activity_Agent**, **Usage_Agent**, **Load_Agent** and **Price_Agent**:\n","\n","\n","*   The activity agent returns the probability that persons are present and in an \"active state\" in the house at each given hour of the day.\n","*   The usage agent returns the probability that a given to-be-recommended-device will be used on the next day.\n","*   The load agent returns a typical load profile for each to-be-recommended-device\n","*   The price agent returns the day-ahead-prices for the next 48 hours\n","\n","2. It then computes the cost associated with launching the devices at each hour of he next day (based on the devices' typical load profiles and the day ahead electricity prices).\n","\n","3. Finally it recommends the cheapest launching hour among the set of hours at which users are likely present and active **[Probability(Present&Active)> Threshold]**. A recommendation  for a given device is made only if the user is likely enough to use the device on the next day **[Probability(Device_Usage)> Threshold]**\n","\n","\n","In the present script, we will build this **Recommendation_Agent** step by step. For that purpose, we will first load and preprocess the required data with the preprocessing agents. Then, we will iteratively add functions to the **Recommendation_Agent class** in order to finally build a function entitled \"Pipeline\", which ouputs the desired recommendations."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"XwYZuk7-e7XK"},"source":["## **1.
